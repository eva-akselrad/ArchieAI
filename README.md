## Setup

1. Install [Ollama](https://ollama.ai/) on your system
2. Pull a model that supports tool calling: `ollama pull qwen3` (recommended for tool calling support)
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure your model:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
4. Edit `.env` and set your preferred model (e.g., `MODEL=qwen3`)
5. Install Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
6. Initialize data directories:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p data/sessions
   echo '{}' > data/qna.json
   ```
7. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python src/app.py
   ```
8. Access the web interface at `http://localhost:5000`

## Usage

### Getting Started
1. Visit `http://localhost:5000` in your web browser
2. Choose to login with an account or continue as a guest
3. Start chatting with ArchieAI!

### Features Guide

#### Chat History
- Click the history icon (clock) in the chat interface to view previous conversations
- Click "Load" to switch to a previous chat session

#### Account Management

#### Web Search
ArchieAI uses Ollama's tool calling feature to intelligently search the web when:
- The scraped university data doesn't contain the answer
- The query requires current/real-time information
- The AI determines additional information is needed
- **Note:** Requires a model with tool calling support (e.g., qwen3)

#### Session Context
- Each conversation maintains context within the session
- Recent messages (last 5) are used to provide context for responses
- Context is preserved when loading previous sessions

## API Endpoints

### Chat Endpoints
- `POST /api/archie` - Send a question (non-streaming)
- `POST /api/archie/stream` - Send a question (streaming response)

### Session Management
- `GET /api/sessions/history` - Get current session history
- `GET /api/sessions/list` - List all user sessions (requires login)
- `GET /api/sessions/<id>` - Get specific session details
- `DELETE /api/sessions/<id>` - Delete a session
- `POST /api/sessions/new` - Create new session
- `POST /api/sessions/switch/<id>` - Switch to different session

## Data Storage

All data is stored locally in JSON files:
- `data/users.json` - User accounts with hashed passwords
- `data/sessions/*.json` - Individual chat sessions
- `data/scrape_results.json` - Cached university data from web scraping
- `data/qna.json` - Question-answer pairs (legacy storage)

## Development

To run the web scraper manually:
```bash
python src/helpers/scraper.py
```

The scraper runs in a loop and updates university data every hour.
