History Arcadia’s Systems of Support Community and Local Connections Healthy Knights About Arcadia Home / About Arcadia Home / About Arcadia OUR MISSION Arcadia University provides a distinctively global, integrative, and personal learning experience for intellectually curious undergraduate and graduate students in preparation for a life of scholarship, service, and professional contribution. OUR VISION Arcadia University’s pioneering, global, integrated, liberal arts and professional learning experience cultivates leaders who are intellectually fearless and uniquely prepared for life and work. Our highly regarded, values-based learning community reflects the world in which we want to live. 2,163 undergraduate students 1,447 graduate students 75 programs / fields of study Arcadia’s Mission, Vision, and Values Our Lived Values Adaptability We prepare community members with the nimbleness to address the multifaceted challenges of civic life and to pursue new strategies in a dynamic world.

Responsibility We are committed stewards of Arcadia, and we will ensure that decisions are made in accordance with our institutional mission, goals, and guidelines. I chose Arcadia for a lot of reasons. But the biggest ones for me were the environment of the campus and the community when I visited. I wanted to go somewhere where I would be close to people. I didn’t want to go to a big campus. Arcadia isn’t giant. And it felt right when I visited. It clicked.

It could be: A store that closed? A community hangout spot? An ice cream truck or bakery? A sense of togetherness or neighborly traditions? A festival, block party, or activity we no longer see? Sometimes the things we miss say a lot about what made our neighborhoods special and what we might be able to bring back in a new way. I’d love to read your memories!
